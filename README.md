# Project Title: Unpaired Image Translation Generative Adversarial Network Algorithm Comparison

Tyler Kinkade

The goal of this project was to compare the effectiveness of two unsupervised generative adversarial network machine learning algorithms in translating real-life photos to Ukiyoe-style images. 
See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tyknkd/unpaired-image-translation/blob/main/project.ipynb) for the complete report.
